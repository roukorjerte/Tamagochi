## 📝 Lessons learned

This was the first time I built a complete UI-driven app in C#.  
I practiced:
- Using sound and animation to build feedback
- Managing user input and pet behavior

It also taught me that **finishing projects** feels *really* good 💪

## 🧸 Future ideas

- Add animations and different images for different animals
- Add mini-games (e.g. ball throwing)
- Save/load pet progress
- Add random events (like the pet asking questions or telling jokes!)
